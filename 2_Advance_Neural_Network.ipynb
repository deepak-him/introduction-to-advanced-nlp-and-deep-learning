Initially, the training accuracy was moderately high and continued to improve with each epoch, reaching a very high accuracy by the final epoch. The training loss also decreased substantially, indicating that the model was learning effectively. On the validation set, the accuracy improved overall, despite some fluctuations, and remained relatively high by the end of training. The validation loss initially decreased but then increased slightly in the later epochs, suggesting some overfitting as the model's complexity increased. Overall, the model demonstrated strong learning capability with high training accuracy and reasonably high validation accuracy."

However, the validation accuracy stabilizes after initial improvement, and the validation loss fluctuates slightly, suggesting that while the model learns well, its ability to generalize to new data does not continue to improve significantly after a few epochs. This pattern indicates potential overfitting, highlighting the need for techniques like regularization or early stopping to enhance generalization performance."
